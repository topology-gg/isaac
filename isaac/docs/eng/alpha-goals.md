# Open Alpha: Goals

### Playtest core game mechanics
Core game mechanics involve coordination among anons on Discord to strategically manage resource and production pipeline. Objective of the reality is to survive and escape the hostile trisolar system by piloting the planet via NDPE launches. Through Open Alpha playtesting, Topology hopes to cultivate open discussion around core game mechanics that could be adjusted and deepened to enrich the reality.

### Prep for decentralized development
Topology imagines itself to be the seeder and the first steward of the Isaac reality, which evolves organically via an open game-development process. In CarseDAO's terminology, Topology is the first Angel of Isaac and nothing more. Open Alpha invites gamers to inspect game mechanics, Isaac DAO governance rules, and their smart contract implementation critically in order to evolve it toward a progressively more inclusive reality and to organically identify Isaac's next Angel (e.g. a developer DAO, or a coalition of DAOs).
