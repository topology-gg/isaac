# Micro simulation

### Grid coordinate system

### Device types

### Logistics (transformation / transportation / generation rates)
- solar power generation depends on solar exposure
- otherwise rate is generally a function of energy supplied

### Device construction
- recipe

### Device placement
- device footprint

### Utx set placement
- contiguity test

### NDPE launches
One player launches, the entire civilization launches => forced coordination.

### Micro world forwarding
- analogous to circuit simuation
