# Open Alpha: Rules

### Three Views
1. [Station](https://isaac-station.netlify.app/): Join queue, dispatch to universe, replay current & past civilizations.
2. [Space View](https://isaac-space-view.netlify.app/): Examine the state of the universe at macro level.
3. [Working View](https://isaac-working-view.netlify.app/): Examine and initiate strategic construction activities on Ev.

### Entry qualification
- Account addresses that have solved one [Solve2Mint 2.0](https://s2m2.netlify.app/) puzzle can join the queue at Station.
- Topology retains the right to give certain partners and collaborators direct access to join the queue.

### Universe setup
- Only **one universe** is available: Universe #0.
- **Civilization size is set to 20**. The queue becomes dispatchable once filled up to 20 queued accounts.
- **Ev's dimension is set to 100**. The side of the cuboid Ev is 100 units long, hence total surface area is 6*100^2 = 60000 1x1 grids.
- **Starting loadout includes one NDPE**. At civilization birth, every player gets a starting loadout of devices, including one NDPE.
- All civilizations start with **the same initial universe state** - the same initial positions and velocities for all celestial bodies.
- **Chaos is turned off** - the Fiat-Shamir random disturbances to Ev's dynamic are not activated i.e. the universe is perfectly deterministic.
