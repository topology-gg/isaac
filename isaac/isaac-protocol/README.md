# Isaac Protocol

### Introduction
Isaac Protocol represents an experiment for Open Game Development directly on the blockchain. Following the spirit of Solve2Mint (S2M; https://www.guiltygyoza.xyz/2022/02/solve2mint; https://solve2mint.netlify.app/), Isaac Protocol experiments with the concept of Play2Govern (P2G). P2G is a governance framework that distributes governance right to those who contribute the most in playing an onchain game. P2G is an implication of running a game, or a *reality*, fully onchain, such that quantitative metrics can be derived directly from gameplay/participation activity onchain; the derivation (or more formally, `function : onchain-activity -> governance right`) is encoded immutably in smart contract, enhancing credible neutrality of the governance protocol.


### Function
1. Governance right calculation and distribution
2. Proposal submission, proposal voting, decision exercising
3. Player signup, matchmaking, manage Isaac instance lifetime

### Tenets
1. Minimize governance
2. Simplicity leads to robustness, accessibility and inclusivity

### Core idea
1. Play-to-govern (P2G): to better one plays Isaac, the more say one has in the evolution of the Isaac reality
